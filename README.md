# Uplift

### [Live Site](https://uplift-reactjs.vercel.app/)

## Introduction
Produced a exercise guide website using React.js by pulling exercise data from Rapid API to access 1000+ exercises, pulled related exercise video links from Youtube via API, and a horizoontal scroll section to suggest similar exercises.

## Future Plans:
- I plan to remove the horizontal scroll on the body part selection and turn it into a grid of icons to select from. 
- The pagination of the exercises will be changed to lazy loading on scroll with the implementation of Intersection Observer.
- Change the suggested Youtube video images into an embedded video on the page.
